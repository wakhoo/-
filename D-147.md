`var favoriteFood = 'pizza'
var numOfSlices = 8
console.log(favoriteFood)
console.log(numOfSlices)`

There were a lot of changes introduced in the ES6 version of JavaScript in 2015. 
One of the biggest changes was two new keywords, let and const, to create, or declare, variables. 
Prior to the ES6, programmers could only use the var keyword to declare variables.

Another concept that we should be aware of when using let (and even var) is that we can declare a variable without assigning the variable a value. 
In such a case, the variable will be automatically initialized with a value of undefined:

`let price;
console.log(price); // Output: undefined
price = 350;
console.log(price); // Output: 350`

`let changeMe=true
changeMe=false
console.log(changeMe)`

However, a **const variable cannot be reassigned** because it is constant. If you try to reassign a const variable, you’ll get a TypeError.

Constant variables must be assigned a value when declared. If you try to declare a const variable without a value, **you’ll get a SyntaxError**.
